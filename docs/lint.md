# Lint

[Back to README.md](README.md)

`prototool lint` lints your Protobuf files.

Lint rules can be set using the configuration file. See the configuration at
[etc/config/example/prototool.yaml](../etc/config/example/prototool.yaml) for all available
options. There are three pre-configured groups of rules, the setting of which is integral to the
`prototool lint`, `prototool create`, and `prototool format` commands:

- `uber2`: This lint group follows the [V2 Uber Style Guide](../style/README.md), and makes some
  modifications to more closely follow the Google Cloud APIs file structure, as well as adding even
  more rules to enforce more consistent development patterns. This is the lint group we recommend
  using.
- `uber1`: This lint group follows the [V1 Uber Style Guide](../etc/style/uber1/uber1.proto). For
  backwards compatibility reasons, this is the default lint group, however we recommend using the
  `uber2` lint group.
- `google`: This lint group follows the
  [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style). This is a small
  group of rules meant to enforce basic naming. The style guide is copied to
  [etc/style/google/google.proto](../etc/style/google/google.proto).

To see the differences between lint groups, use the `--diff-lint-groups` flag:

```
prototool lint --diff-lint-groups uber1,uber2
```

Configuration of your group can be done by setting the `lint.group` option in your `prototool.yaml`
file:

```yaml
lint:
  group: uber2
```

See the `prototool.yaml` files at
[etc/style/google/prototool.yaml](../etc/style/google/prototool.yaml) and
[etc/style/uber1/prototool.yaml](../etc/style/uber1/prototool.yaml) for examples.

There is also the special lint group `empty`, which has no lint rules. This allows one to specify
only the linters they want in `lint.rules.add`:

> 还有特殊的lint组是`empty`，没有lint规则。这允许一个人指定只有他们想要的`lint.rules.add`中的绒毛：
>

```yaml
lint:
  group: empty
  rules:
    add:
      - MESSAGE_NAMES_CAMEL_CASE
      - MESSAGE_NAMES_CAPITALIZED
```



You can configure ignoring of lint rules on a per-file basis:

> 您可以基于每个文件配置lint的忽略规则：

```yaml
lint:
  ignores:
    - id: MESSAGE_NAMES_CAMEL_CASE
      files:
        - foo.proto
        - bar/baz.proto
```

To generate the a YAML configuration for currently-failing lint rules that can be copied into your
configuration file, use `--generate-ignores`. This will lint your files, ignoring the existing
setting for `lint.ignores`, and print a new value for it. Note that you should make sure not to
touch other settings for `lint` in your configuration file as this flag only generates the
`lint.ignores` option.

> 要为当前失败的lint规则生成YAML配置，可以复制这些rules到您的配置文件，使用`--generate-ignores`。将会使你的配置文件忽略已经存在的`lint.ignores`设置，并为它赋予一个新值。请注意，你应该确保不移动配置文件中lint的其他设置，因为此标志仅生成`lint.ignores` 选项。
>

```
prototool lint path/to/dir --generate-ignores
```



Linting also understands the concept of file headers, typically license headers. To specify a file
header, add the following to your `prototool.yaml`:

> Linting也支持文件格式的header头文件，通常许可证头信息，指定文件header添加如下配置到`prototool.yaml`中：

```yaml
lint:
  file_header:
    path: path/to/header.txt
    is_commented: true
```

Alternatively, directly specify the content:

> 或者，直接指定内容：

```yaml
lint:
  file_header:
    content: |
      //
      // Acme, Inc. (c) 2019
      //
    is_commented: true
```

The `path` option specifies the path to the file that contains the header data. The `content`
option specifies the content directly. Only one of these can be specified. The `is_commented`
option specifies whether the header data is already commented, and if not, `// ` will be added
before all non-empty lines, and `//` will be added before all empty lines. `is_commented` is
optional and generally will not be set if the file is not commented, for example if `path` points
to a text LICENSE file.

> （`path`选项指定包含header头数据的文件路径。`content`选项直接指定内容。只能指定其中之一。`is_commented`选项指定header头内容是否已注释，如果没有，将在所有非空行和所有空行之前添加//。`is_commented`是可选的，如果文件没有被注释，通常不会设置，例如如果`path`指向到文本LICENSE文件。）

If `lint.file_header.path` or `lint.file_header.content` is set, `prototool lint`,
`prototool create`, and `prototool format --fix` will all take the file header into account.    

>   (如果 `lint.file_header.path` 或者 `lint.file_header.content` 已经设置,header头文件对`prototool lint`,`prototool create`,  `prototool format --fix` 都生效 )

See [internal/cmd/testdata/lint](../internal/cmd/testdata/lint) for additional examples of
configurations, and run `prototool lint internal/cmd/testdata/lint/DIR` from a checkout of this
repository to see example failures.

> （有关其他示例，请参阅内部[internal/cmd/testdata/lint](../internal/cmd/testdata/lint) 配置，并运行 `prototool lint internal/cmd/testdata/lint/DIR` 在存储库查看故障示例。）

Files must be valid Protobuf that can be compiled with `protoc`, so prior to linting,
`prototool lint` will compile your using `protoc`. Note, however, this is very fast - for the two
files in [etc/style/uber1](../etc/style/uber1), compiling and linting only takes approximately
3/100ths of a second: （文件必须是可用`protoc`编译的有效Protobuf，因此在linting之前，`prototool lint`将使用`protoc`编译您的文件。然而，请注意，这是非常快的-对于两个 [etc/style/uber1](../etc/style/uber1)中的文件，编译和筛选只需要大约百分之三秒：）

```bash
$ time prototool lint etc/style/uber1

real	0m0.037s
user	0m0.026s
sys	0m0.017s
```

For all 694 Protobuf files currently in [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
this takes approximately 3/4ths of a second: 

> (对于目前googleapis中的所有694个Protobuf文件，这大约需要四分之三秒：)

```bash
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis (push)

$ cat prototool.yaml
protoc:
  allow_unused_imports: true
lint:
  group: google

$ time prototool lint

real	0m0.734s
user	0m3.835s
sys	0m0.924s
```
